# Abigen for zoomers

Just a simple wrapper to fetch abis from etherscan and run [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) on it.

Uses the `name` of a contract if possible.

## Usage
First put your etherscan api key in the environment variable ETHERSCAN_API_KEY.

Then simply run
```
âžœ abigenz 0xD63751B0fBef5F0153c69D6429Ed1429B6F79247 # or any contract address
```

Which will output
```
